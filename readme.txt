# User Authentication System

This User Authentication System is built using Python Flask and MySQL. It provides basic user authentication functionalities, including user signup and login with secure password handling.

## Project Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- MySQL Server
- Flask
- Flask-MySQLdb
- bcrypt

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url-here
   cd path-to-your-project
Set up a Python Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure MySQL:

Ensure MySQL server is running.

Create a database using MySQL CLI or a tool like phpMyAdmin:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE user_authentication;
Import the SQL schema located in schema.sql:

bash
Copy code
mysql -u username -p user_authentication < path/to/schema.sql
Environment Variables:

Set environment variables for the database connection:

bash
Copy code
export MYSQL_HOST=localhost
export MYSQL_USER=root
export MYSQL_PASSWORD=yourpassword
export MYSQL_DB=user_authentication
Alternatively, update the database configuration in app.py directly.

Running the Application
Start the Flask Server:

bash
Copy code
flask run
Or:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the server on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Access the Application:

Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/signup_form to access the signup form.
Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/login_form to access the login form.
Testing
You can test the API endpoints using a tool like Postman:

POST /signup to create a new user.
POST /login to authenticate a user.
Additional Information
Ensure to replace placeholders like your-repository-url-here, username, yourpassword, and path-to-your-project with actual values relevant to your setup.
